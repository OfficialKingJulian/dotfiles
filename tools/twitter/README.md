# Tweet Tools

This is mainly just a tool to create randomly scheduled tweets. It's very useful for me, because I don't like to post to twitter and immediately worry about what I've posted, so I use this to simply say what I want to say on twitter, and then not worry about the consequences ( which are for tomorrow's me to worry about :) ).

- [x] Basic functionality, getting a random date and posting it, removing the cron afterwards
- [ ] Allow user to input a date and time
- [ ] Currently, it would only work with one tweet per day; either fix this, or make it so it wouldn't break if it randomly selected two per day instead etc.
